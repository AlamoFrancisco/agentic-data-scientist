### Dataset notes

**titanic.csv** — Small classification dataset with real-world data quality issues. Triggers: `handle_outliers` (fare distribution), `handle_severe_missing_data` (deck: 77% missing), `apply_robust_scaling`, `drop_leaky_features` (the `alive` column is a direct text encoding of the target and is dropped via mutual information detection).

**digits.csv** — Medium classification dataset with 64 pixel features. Triggers: `handle_outliers`, `drop_near_constant_features` (14 border pixels with ≥95% zero values). A good test for the near-constant column detection.

**wine_sklearn.csv** — Small multiclass classification dataset. Good for testing the agent on clean numeric chemistry features without obvious leakage or missing-data complications.

**Sales.csv** — Large regression dataset. Triggers: `apply_target_encoding` (model_name: 899 unique values), `drop_leaky_features` (final_price_usd: normalised MI = 1.0 with revenue_usd), `use_ensemble_models`. Illustrates the limitation of per-feature leakage detection: even after dropping final_price_usd, the combination of base_price_usd × discount_percent × units_sold still perfectly reconstructs revenue_usd.

**WineQuality.csv** — Medium regression dataset. Used in smoke tests to verify regression pipeline. All-numeric features, no leakage.

**diabetes_sklearn.csv** — Small-to-medium regression dataset with standardized numeric features. Useful for checking regression behavior on a real dataset without high-cardinality categoricals.

### Notes on demo.csv
`demo.csv` is a 20-row synthetic dataset included only to verify the code runs. It is too small for meaningful model training and should not be used as an evaluation dataset.
